# SkyblockSandbox (code coming soon)
This is the official repository for my take on Hypixel Skyblock.
Note that at the moment, there isn't any code! I would star/watch this repo on Github and wait for further updates.
(release date droping soon!)

# For Server Adminsistrators
If you plan to use code from this plugin or use the plugin it self, please give credit. Under the license, you must disclose the source and disclose any chances made.

# Installing
There are multiple versions of installation. One for singleplayer usage, and another for multiplayer private servers.

### Installing for Multiplayer
1. Go to releases and download the latest version of the plugin. Usually labeled as "SkyblockSandbox v(VERSION SYMBOL)"
2. Place the plugin in your plugins folder.
3. Run "/sandbox" to get information about what to do next.

### Installing for Singleplayer
Currently, you have to follow the multiplayer instructions and join your localhost server.
But I am making a UNIX and Windows command-line based Paper installer which installs everything for the user automatically.
